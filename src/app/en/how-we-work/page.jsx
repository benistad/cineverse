              Our Review Criteria
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">

              Why Original Version?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              We strongly recommend watching films in their original language with subtitles. Here's why:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
              <li>You experience the actors' authentic performances and voice work</li>
              <li>The original soundtrack and sound design remain intact</li>
              <li>Cultural nuances and wordplay are preserved</li>
              <li>You get the director's intended viewing experience</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
              While dubbed versions can be convenient, they often lose the emotional depth and authenticity of the original performances.
